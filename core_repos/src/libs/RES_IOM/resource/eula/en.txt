this license which is owned or licensed by a party other than Iomega (hereafter “Third Party”) and 
which is accompanied by a license agreement from that Third Party is licensed under that 
agreement and is not licensed hereunder, and you will look solely to that Third Party and not to 
Iomega in enforcing any rights you may be granted under that agreement or any obligations 
related to that software.
　
1.    LICENSE GRANT
A.  This is a license, not a sales agreement, between You, the end user, and Iomega Corporation, 
Iomega Latin America, Inc., or Iomega International SA. as applicable.  Iomega Corporation, a 
Delaware corporation, markets and supports the Software in North America.  Iomega Latin 
America, Inc, markets and supports the Software in Latin America and South America. Iomega 
International SA markets and supports the Software in Europe, Asia, the Middle East and Africa. 
Your location of first use of the Software determines which is the licensing entity hereunder (the

nonexclusive, worldwide, non-transferable (except as permitted below), perpetual, revocable 
license, under all of Iomega's Intellectual Property Rights (defined below) in the Software, to: (i) 
install (however, only for Software distributed on a stand-alone basis or with respect to any 
clients of the Software required for use with the Software), use, perform, and display the 
Software solely in accordance with the documentation provided to you along with the Software (
the "Documentation") for your personal or internal business purposes and only on, or in conjunction 
with, the Iomega device with which it was distributed; and, (ii) make as many copies of the 
Software in machine readable form as permitted by the license code (the "License Code") provided 
to you solely for backup or archive purposes.  The following additional conditions apply to the 
license if the Software was distributed to you on a stand-alone basis, is not a client for use with 
other Software, and is not software which is required to be used in connection with an Iomega 
device: (a) you shall install the Software on only one computer, and (b) you shall physically transfer 
the Software from one computer or applicable device to another provided that the Software is 
used on only one such device at a time.  Any copy you make under this Section must include the 
Iomega copyright notice and any other proprietary notices.  As used herein, "Intellectual Property 
Rights" means all present and future copyrights, trademark rights, trade secret rights, patent 
rights, and any other intellectual property rights recognized in any jurisdiction, and which includes 
the respective rights of any third party licensors.
C.  All rights, title, interest, and all copyrights in and to the Software, Documentation, and any copy 
made by you remain with Iomega, its subsidiaries, and affiliates, as well as its licensors (and their 
respective licensors), its affiliated companies, suppliers or distributors (“Iomega Parties”).  You are 
prohibited from deleting or in any manner altering or obscuring the copyright notices, trademarks, 
logos or related notices, or other proprietary rights notices of Iomega or Iomega Parties 
appearing on or within the Software or Documentation.
D. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, in the event that any component or code 
within the Software licensed to you hereunder is governed by a properly applicable Free and Open 
Source Software license (“FOSS license”), nothing herein shall narrow, supersede or limit such 
FOSS license.
2. RESTRICTIONS.  
A.  You acknowledge that the Software and its structure, organization, and source code contain 
valuable trade secrets of Iomega and Iomega Parties, respectively.  Accordingly, you agree not to (
a) modify, adapt, alter, translate, or create derivative works from the Software; (b) merge the 
Software with other software; (c) sublicense, lease, rent, loan, or otherwise transfer (except as 
permitted under Section 8) the Software or Documentation in any form to any third party; (d)

bureau or time sharing arrangement; or (f) otherwise use or copy the Software except as

the Software (including all distributed clients, to the extent applicable) as well as any 
Documentation and packaging provided with the Software. Unauthorized copying of the Software 
or the Documentation, your use of Iomega or Iomega Parties’ Intellectual Property Rights in a 
manner not in accordance with this Agreement or as otherwise licensed, or your failure to comply 
with this Agreement including by way of example, restrictions in Section 1, 2, 4 or 8 will result in 
breach and automatic termination of this license and will make available to Iomega other legal and 
equitable remedies. Upon termination of this Agreement, you must destroy or return the Software, 
the Documentation, and the License Code, and all copies thereof.
4. COMPLIANCE WITH LAW.  
A.  You agree to comply with all applicable laws with respect to the exercise of your rights under 
this Agreement, including but not limited to, all privacy laws, and you agree not to export or re-
export the Software in violation of the U.S. Export Administration regulations or other applicable 
laws and regulations.  In particular, but without limitation, you acknowledge and agree that the 
Software may not be exported or re-exported (a) into any U.S. embargoed countries or (b) to 
anyone on the U.S. Treasury Department's list of Specially Designated Nationals or the U.S. 
Department of Commerce Denied Person’s List or Entity List. By using the Software, you 
represent and warrant that you are not located in any such country or on any such list. You also 
agree that you will not use the Software or Iomega device for any purposes prohibited by United 
States law, including, without limitation, the development, design, manufacture or production of 
nuclear, missiles, or chemical or biological weapons.  You will defend, indemnify, and hold harmless 
Iomega and Iomega Parties from and against all claims, fines, penalties, liabilities, damages, costs, 
and expenses incurred by Iomega or its licensors as a result of any violation of such laws and 
regulations by you or any of your agents or employees.
5. WARRANTY DISCLAIMER.  
A. Iomega warrants that if the Software is provided to you on a media disk then the media disk(s) 
on which the Software is furnished shall be free from defects in material and workmanship for a 
period of ninety (90) days from the date of purchase.  Iomega will, at its own expense and as its 
sole obligation and your exclusive remedy for any breach of this warranty, replace any defective 
media returned to Iomega within this Media Warranty Period.  The foregoing warranty is void if 
failure of the media disk(s) is from misuse, neglect, abuse, alteration, improper installation, 
unauthorized repair or modification, improper testing, accident or causes external to the disk(s), 
such as, but not limited to, excessive heat or humidity or  power failure.  The foregoing limited 
warranty shall not be applicable unless and until you pay for the Software.  
B.  Continued use or possession of the disks after expiration of the above ninety (90) day 
warranty period shall be conclusive evidence that the warranty is fulfilled to your full satisfaction.  
Iomega's warranty as set forth above shall not be enlarged, diminished or affected by, and no 
liability shall arise out of, Iomega's rendering of technical advice or service in connection with the 
Software or Iomega statements concerning product quality, support or customer satisfaction.  
The warranty set forth above is not assignable by you. 
C.  THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE BUNDLED OR OFFERED WITH ANY IOMEGA PRODUCT IS NOT 
WARRANTED BY IOMEGA, BUT MAY BE SUBJECT TO ANY WARRANTY THE THIRD PARTY 
MANUFACTURER MAY ELECT TO PROVIDE, AS REFLECTED IN THE DOCUMENTATION INCLUDED 
WITH THAT SOFTWARE.  ANY OTHER IOMEGA PRODUCT THAT ACCOMPANIES THIS 
SOFTWARE IS DISTRIBUTED UNDER THE WARRANTY SET FORTH ON ITS PACKAGING. 
D. EXCEPT FOR THE EXPRESS WARRANTY STATED ABOVE, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT 
PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE SOFTWARE, ALL MEDIA DISKS AND DOCUMENTATION 
ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND “AS AVAILABLE,” WITH ALL FAULTS AND WITHOUT A WARRANTY 
OF ANY KIND FROM IOMEGA, ITS SUBSIDIARIES, AND ITS AFFILIATES, OR ITS LICENSORS, 
SUPPLIERS OR DISTRIBUTORS (COLLECTIVELY “IOMEGA PARTIES”).  EXCEPT FOR THE 
WARRANTIES SPECIFICALLY SET FORTH HEREIN, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY 
APPLICABLE LAW THESE PARTIES HEREBY DISCLAIM All OTHER WARRANTIES AND 
CONDITIONS EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BY WAY OF EXAMPLE, ANY IMPLIED 
WARRANTY OR CONDITION OF MERCHANTABILITY, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, NON-
INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS, ACCURACY, CORRECTNESS, OR FITNESS FOR A 
PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND ANY WARRANTY ARISING BY STATUTE, OPERATION OF LAW, 
COURSE OF DEALING OR PERFORMANCE, OR USAGE OF TRADE.  OTHER THAN THE 
WARRANTIES CONTAINED IN THIS SECTION 5, THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND 
PERFORMANCE OF THE SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU, AND YOU ASSUME THE ENTIRE COST OF 
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW 
LIMITATIONS ON IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. 
THIS WARRANTY GIVES YOU SPECIFIC LEGAL RIGHTS. YOU MAY ALSO HAVE OTHER RIGHTS 
WHICH VARY FROM JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION.
　
6.  LIMITATION OF REMEDIES AND LIABILITY.   
A.  Your sole and exclusive remedy under this Agreement shall be refund, repair or replacement of 
defective media and/or device as provided in the warranty, at Iomega's option, but not the data 
thereon.  The maximum liability of Iomega and Iomega Parties for any claim by you or anyone 
claiming through or on behalf of you arising out of or related to the Software or the warranty 
shall not in any event exceed the greater of the actual amount paid by you to Iomega for the 
Software or fifty U.S. Dollars. 
B.  Iomega does NOT warrant that the functions contained in the Software will meet your 
requirements or that the operation of the Software will be uninterrupted, timely or error free. 
You acknowledge that computer software is inherently subject to bugs and potential 
incompatibility with other computer software and hardware.  You should not use the Software for 
any applications in which failure could cause any significant damage or injury to persons or 
tangible or intangible property.  
C.  You should be sure that all data files and programs are properly backed up to prevent data 
loss that could result from a Software malfunction or other occurrence. IN NO EVENT SHALL 
IOMEGA OR IOMEGA PARTIES BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, COLLATERAL, 
EXEMPLARY, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR SPECIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES ARISING OUT OF 
YOUR PURCHASE OR USE OF ANY PRODUCTS INCLUDING SOFTWARE OR DOCUMENTATION 
OBTAINED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY FROM IOMEGA, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOSS OF 
USE, LOST PROFITS, GOODWILL OR SAVINGS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, OR LOSS OF DATA, 
DATA FILES, OR OTHER PROGRAMS OR LOSS OF SYSTEMS OR REPLACEMENT SYSTEMS, 
EVEN IF IOMEGA OR ITS LICENSORS KNEW OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN OF THE POSSIBILITY OF 
SUCH DAMAGES.  SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF 
CERTAIN INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES, SO THE 
ABOVE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. 
D. IOMEGA’S AND IOMEGA PARTIES’ TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY ARISING FROM OR 
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE SOFTWARE, OR THE DOCUMENTATION, WHETHER BASED 
IN TORT, CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE WILL NOT EXCEED THE GREATER AMOUNT OF FEES 
PAID FOR THE SOFTWARE OR THE PRICE PAID FOR THE IOMEGA PRODUCT ASSOCIATED WITH 
THE SOFTWARE.  THESE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY WILL BE GIVEN FULL EFFECT EVEN IF THE 
WARRANTY PROVIDED IN SECTION 5 IS DEEMED INEFFECTIVE. 
7.  UPDATES AND SUPPORT
A.  You may be entitled to receive technical support for as long as Iomega offers such support 
for the Software version you have licensed.  You understand that Iomega may, in its discretion, 
charge for such support.  For some Software (e.g., certain stand-alone Software) such support 
generally begins when Iomega begins licensing that version of the Software to the public and 
ceases six months after the release of the next major version of the Software. Alternatively, the 
Software related support may run concurrent with the support provided on the Iomega device 
with which the Software was distributed.  Iomega's specific customer support policies (including 
fees or services) and procedures change as technology and market conditions dictate.  If the 
licensor is Iomega Corporation or Iomega Latin America Inc., to obtain information about Iomega's 
current policies please visit our Web site at www.iomega.com/supportpolicy.html or write us at

B.  You may receive software updates (“Updates” are defined as, and limited to, version number 
changes to the hundredth decimal place) in accordance with Iomega policies as announced from 
time to time which may include charges for such Updates.  Iomega's policy on updates and support 
is subject to change at any time and are listed on Iomega’s web site. You acknowledge that, except 
as may be required by applicable law, Iomega is not obligated under this Agreement to generally 
make any Updates or level of support available. All Updates shall be provided via the worldwide 
web and Iomega shall have no responsibility for the installation of any such Updates.  Any Updates 
shall be governed by this Agreement.
8. ASSIGNMENT.  Except as permitted in this Section, you may not assign or transfer any of the 
rights under this Agreement (including the license to use the Software) to any third party without 
the prior written consent of Iomega.  You may transfer the Software, the Documentation, the 
License Code, and all rights under this Agreement to a third party only if such third party agrees 
to accept the terms and conditions of this Agreement.  Any attempted transfer in violation of the 
foregoing will be null and void.
9. GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION.  With respect to: (a) Iomega Corporation and Iomega Latin 
America, Inc., this Agreement will be governed by the laws of the State of Utah in the U.S.A., 
without regard to the principles of conflict of laws or the United Nations Convention on Contracts

in connection with this Agreement including the validity, invalidity, breach or termination thereof 
shall be heard in the state and federal courts in Salt Lake County, Utah.  (b) Iomega International,

conflict of laws or the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of 
Goods; and, any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, 
including the validity, invalidity, breach or termination thereof, shall be finally resolved by binding

Commerce in force on the date when the Notice of Arbitration is submitted in accordance with 
these Rules.  The number of arbitrators shall be three (3), the seat of the arbitration shall be 
Geneva, Switzerland, and the arbitral proceedings shall be conducted in the English language.

personal delivery, (b) 24 hours after sending by air courier or electronic means, or (c) 72 hours

48 C.F.R. 2.101, consisting of "commercial computer software" and "commercial computer software 
documentation" as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212.  Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 
C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4, all U.S. Government end users acquire the Software with

secrets and proprietary information of Iomega and Iomega Parties, respectively.  You further 
acknowledge that any actual or threatened breach of Sections 1, 2 or 4 of this Agreement will 
constitute immediate, irreparable harm to Iomega and/or Iomega Parties for which monetary 
damages would be an inadequate remedy, and that injunctive relief is an appropriate remedy for 
such breach.
13. GENERAL. (i) All waivers by Iomega must be in writing. (ii) You agree to be responsible for the 
payment of any taxes resulting from this Agreement.  (iii) A party's failure to exercise any of its 
rights under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver or forfeiture of any such rights nor of 
any other rights.  (iv) If any provision of this Agreement is unenforceable or invalid pursuant to 
any applicable law, such unenforceability or invalidity will not render this Agreement unenforceable 
or invalid as a whole, and such unenforceable or invalid provision will be changed and interpreted 
so as to best accomplish the objectives of such provision within the limits of applicable law or 
applicable court decisions.  (v) Any provision that by its nature or context is intended to survive 
any termination or expiration, including but not limited to Sections 2-6, 9-13, shall so survive. (vi) 
This Agreement which incorporates all documents referenced herein represents the entire 
agreement between you and Iomega as to the matters set forth herein and integrates all prior 
discussions and understanding between us.  (vii) Except as described herein, this Agreement may
